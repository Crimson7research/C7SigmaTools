Sigma Transformation Error for 'Unusual File Download from Direct IP Address': Unable to determine table name from rule.  The query table is determined in the following order of priority:
  1) The value provided to processing pipeline's query_table parameter, if using a Python script.
  2) If the query_table is already set in the pipeline state, such as from a custom user-defined pipeline if using sigma-cli.
  3) If the rule's logsource category is present in the pipeline's category_to_table_mappings dictionary in mappings.py, use that value.
  4) If the rule has an EventID, use the table name from the pipeline's eventid_to_table_mappings dictionary in mappings.py.
